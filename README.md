```php
namespace \console\controllers;

class NotificationController extends Controller
{
    public function actionSayHello($say)
    {
        \Yii::info($say);
    }
}
```

#### Push message to queue:

```php
Yii::$app->queue->getChannel('default')->push(
    new MessageModel([
        'worker' => 'notification',
        'method' => 'actionSayHello',
        'arguments' => [
            'say' => 'hello!'
        ]
    ])
);
```

#### Run queue worker daemon (console app):

```bash
$ php ./yii queue/run --pid-file=/tmp/queue.pid
```
